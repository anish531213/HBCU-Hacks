							<p><h4>ELLEN REMMER had wanted to align her investments with her values for years, seeking to put her money into stocks and bonds that would have an impact beyond the returns. For her, this meant investing in organizations that either improved the lot of women and girls or helped the environment.<h4></p>
							<p><h4>Doing so took longer than she expected. Even though it was her money, it was held in trust. She said it wasn’t easy....</h4></p>

							<p><h4>I love this time of year, except for one teeny, tiny thing: charitable giving guilt. You know exactly what I’m talking about. We’ve all walked past that red bucket without dropping in any money. We’ve all said “no” to those requests at the checkout counter to donate $1 to some worthy cause.

Many of us got buried under giving guilt last week on Giving Tuesday. Social media was flooded with all sorts of calls to donate. I bet at least once that day, we</h4></p>
							<p><h4>A friend of mine shared a story that captures this situation perfectly. Out shopping last week, she dropped some money into one of those red buckets. Luckily, the bell ringer hadn’t changed by the time she exited the store. She knew he remembered her donation. No guilt was felt. But then she went to a sec</h4></p>

							<p><h4>In the Mormon Church, the first Sunday of each month is called Fast Sunday. As my kids have pointed out, however, it’s not because it goes by faster than any other Sunday. Quite the opposite, in fact.</h4></p>
							<p><h4>It’s called Fast Sunday because members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or Mormons, use it to fast. We go for a period of two meals without food or water. Then, we’re encouraged to take the money we would have spent on those meals, and more if possible, to make what we refer to as a fast offering. It’s used to care...</h4></p>
